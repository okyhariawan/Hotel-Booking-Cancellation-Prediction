# About The Project:
This is a machine learning classification project that will try to predict whether a booking will be canceled or not using machine learning based on historical data.

# Goals:
1. The goals of this project are to find out the characteristics of customers who cancel bookings and find a pattern in cancelled bookings by doing an exploratory data analysis
2. Build a classification machine learning model to predict cancellation with a target to decrease cancellation rate & increase revenue.
